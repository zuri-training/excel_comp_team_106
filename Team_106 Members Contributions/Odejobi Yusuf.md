### MY CONTRIBUTIONS, TASKED ASSIGNED, ISSUES RESOLVED, SOLUTIONS, LINKS
1. I was tasked as the lead designer to prototype, check, make general changes and corrections where necessary on all the web and mobile screen (used auto layout where necessary, adjusted the spacing to 8px, all designs conform with the design system etc.) This gives the user a seamless experience while using the web and mobile pages.
